# CLC Archive
Welcome to the CLC Archives! This is a collection of all the Cambridge Latin Course stages (1-48 | Edition 4E), all here for your enjoyment and learning benefit. Unfortunately, the cover font does not appear correctly, and some of the stages (1,7,8,19) have other assorted visual issues. If you would like any of the source images or have any other questions, please email me at: <a href="mailto:cmo93003@yahoo.com">cmo93003@yahoo.com</a>.
